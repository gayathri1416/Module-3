# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
items=[1,6,4,7,8,9,5,3]
sum_numbers=0
for x in items:
    sum_numbers+=x
print(sum_numbers)


## Output
<img width="451" height="147" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e955200-8fe1-4123-8a0c-1c9ff17c6ead" />

## Result
Thus the python program is executed successfully.
